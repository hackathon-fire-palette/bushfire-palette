      <h2>Medical Emergency Integrations</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Medical Dispatch Coordination:</strong> Integrate with ambulance dispatch systems for coordinated fire and medical response. Enable dual-response alerts for incidents involving injury, smoke inhalation, or burns.</li>
        <li><strong>Health Risk Mapping:</strong> Overlay vulnerable population data (aged care, hospitals, disability services) on bushfire prediction maps. Prioritize evacuation and medical support based on risk zones.</li>
        <li><strong>First Responder Medical Profiles:</strong> Include paramedic certifications and first aid skills in the roster system. Auto-assign medically trained firefighters to incidents with injury potential.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration with Emergency Health Services:</strong> Connect with state health databases to access nearest trauma centers, air ambulance availability, and real-time hospital capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Medical Equipment Tracking:</strong> Link inventory systems to track medical kits, oxygen tanks, and burn treatment supplies on each fire vehicle. Alert roster managers when equipment is low or expired.</li>
        <li><strong>Predictive Health Alerts:</strong> Use bushfire simulation data to forecast smoke exposure zones. Trigger alerts for respiratory risk and deploy medical teams proactively.</li>
        <li><strong>Incident Reporting and Analytics:</strong> Add modules for medical incident logging during bushfire events. Analyze trends in injuries, response times, and treatment outcomes.</li>
